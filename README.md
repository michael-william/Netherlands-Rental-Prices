<font size = 40 color=darkgreen>Dutch Rental Prices</font><br>
Both my friends and myself have often asked the question, 'How much rent could I charge for my apartment?'  <br>The question becomes very complex as we start assuming that location, size, amenities, furnished, and many more attributes need to be considered when deciding on a rental price. My goal for this project is to build a model that will weigh all the attributes available using data from a popular rental website in the Netherlands, Kamernet. <BR>  
I'll do this by creating a regression model using data from kamernet.nl<br>

Steps:<br>
1. Importing libraries and reading data
2. EDA and re-shaping data for ML pre-processing 
3. Feature engineering
4. Creating model
